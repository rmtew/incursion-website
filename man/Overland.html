 ================<br>
</b></b></b></b> &nbsp;&nbsp;In this version of Incursion, <b>Halls of the Goblin King</b></b></b></b>, all of the action takes place in a dungeon. However, the later, complete version of the game, <b>Return of the Forsaken</b></b></b></b>, will feature an overland map that characters can traverse, quests to complete, guilds to join (much like in Omega) and many of the other features associated with rich worlds in computer RPGs.<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;For now, in this game, the player character can interact with a 'simulated overworld' by ascending the stairs in the entry chamber of the Goblin Caves. A simple selection allows the player to retire, make use of an inn to rest in perfect safety for a night, shop at a nearby adventurers' store run by Roark Ironbeard or return to the dungeon to adventure further.<br>
