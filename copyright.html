License 2: Base Incursion license statement
</p>
<p>
	This is a public statement of licensing for the Incursion source code. 
	It can be copied and included with any other versions of Incursion or
	derived works that are made.<br/>
<br/>
	  Incursion is released under the Open Game License included in its
	online help. Effective immediately, the definition of what constitutes
	original product identity in Incursion is altered to nothing. Every part 
	of the distributed Incursion game (excluding the Allegro graphics library), 
	including the RPG game mechanics, implied setting, manual, world 
	generator, source code, algorithms, monsters, classes, races, flavor 
	text and so forth are to be considered Open Game Content.<br/>
<br/>
	  All parts of Incursion which are the original work of Julian Mensch
	and are not derivative works (as defined by law) of material owned by
	Wizards of the Coast or the authors of components like the Allegro
	graphics library, the ACCENT compiler-compiler or any similar item
	of distinct source are hereby released under the Creative Commons
	Attribution 3.0 Unported license; they are thus dual-licensed as Open
	Game Content and Creative Commons content.<br/>
<br/>
	  Any legal responsibility for interpreting the above paragraph falls to
	the individuals or groups wishing to make use of this content outside
	the OGL. The text above should be understood to release as CC-BY
	only the material that Julian Mensch has the legal right to release,
	and not any content owned by other parties, which Julian Mensch
	does not assert any ownership over.<br/>
<br/>
	  Developing Incursion is aided by the ACCENT compiler compiler,
	which is not part of Incursion -- merely a tool used in its build process.
	I have altered ACCENT to produce C++ source code rather than C.
	ACCENT is licensed as GNU software; therefore my changes must
	retain the same license. ACCENT is not part of the Incursion package,
	merely a related tool which is not subject to binary linkage with
	Incursion -- it is instead a distinct executable which is called as part
	of the automated build process, which is permitted by the GNU license.
	When my altered ACCENT is released, it will include the source code
	under GNU as that license requires.<br/>
<br/>
	  I am issuing a polite and non-legally-binding request not to use copyleft
	or anti-commercial licenses for derivative works composed primarily of 
	Incursion unless licensing conflicts make your project unworkable otherwise.
	This should not be misconstrued as any kind of legal requirement.
